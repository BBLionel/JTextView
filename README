Overview

	JTextView is a replacement UITextView which renders attributed text, and allow
	you to edit it.

Requirements

	JTextView requires CoreText and iOS 4.0 or higher.

	It currently has several limitations:

	1. No spell checking;
	2. No pasteboard support;
	3. Data detectors are not fully implemented*;
	4. Caret is not incorporated yet

	* Data detectors are working for links, phone numbers and addresses. A few notes
	  should be made: 1) For telephone numbers, we always default to call, no option
	  is available for SMS. 2) Calendar integration is not supported, though the code
	  is there to detect and encode it. This is because Apple doesn't provide a way
	  for us to call into Calendar, at least without additional dependencies.

	These items will all by full working (within technical limitations of course)
	before a 1.0 release will be made.
